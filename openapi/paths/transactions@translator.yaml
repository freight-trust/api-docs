  summary: Translate an EDI interchange (Persistent)
  description: >
    Translate an EDI interchange and persist meta information and validation
    status in history.

    This operation accepts a well-formed EDI interchange and (when successfully
    translated) responds

    with an XML representation of the interchange. The `Link` header includes a
    URI that may be used

    for retrieval of validation/status information pertaining to the
    interchange.
