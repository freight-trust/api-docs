  summary: Submit an EDI interchange for validation and conversion (Persistent)
  description: >
    Submit an EDI interchange for validation and conversion to a back-end
    application. This operation

    accepts a well-formed EDI interchange and (when successfully translated)
    responds with an

    EDI format corresponding to the input (e.g. an X12 `997`). The transformed
    interchange is written to

    local server storage (other other queuing system) to be retrieved by or
    forwarded to a back-end

    application for further processing.
